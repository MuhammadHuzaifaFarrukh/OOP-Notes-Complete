The pointer itself (the memory address) is copied from the source object (obj1) to the new object
(obj2)
Both obj 1 and obj 2 now have pointers pointing to the exact same block of memory on the heap.
â€‹If you use obj 2 to change the data at that shared memory location, obj 1
will also appear to have changed, and vice-versa.

//Point of Serious Error : (In case of Dynamic Memory Allocation)
/*
When the first object (obj1) goes out of scope, its destructor runs and calls delete
 on the shared heap memory address.

When the second object (obj1) goes out of scope, its destructor runs and calls delete
on the same memory address.

//We either use copy assignment operator or copy constructor as done above for deep copy
//Because in both cases shallow copy is made
//Copy assignment is the same as copy constructor , with difference that we copy from existing object so first we clear our destination object and fill it with new data from copying object
