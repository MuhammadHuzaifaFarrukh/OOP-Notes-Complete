By using this information , you will know how to change , modify and write data in images so that you can work with them.
You can store them in File.
You can do all the operations of image editing using file handling , but you need to know of the basic concepts about it first.
We will work with PPM and PGM files both in binary and ASCII .
An Image is like a combination of numbers stored in a 2D grid (matrix).
PGM file is a portable gray map image which is a white and black image with each number representing a pixel representing a specific color
PPM file is a portable pix map image which is a colored image with each 3 numbers representing a pixel representing a specific color. 

Each Image picture has a header , containing its info about extension , then metadata containing info about width , height of the image and then maximum value . Then it contains the Image data . 
Header and Metadata may vary in various image formats but usually these things are definitely present.
