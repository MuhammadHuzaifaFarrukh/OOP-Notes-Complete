C++ Complete File Classes Hierarchy (Older C++ 98 Versions): 
      ios_base
          |
         ios	      (Separate Header files)
    /            \
   /              \
istream       ostream (Separate Header files)
  \               /
   \             /
      iostream	      (A Class that is in the Header File Inherited from istream & ostream)
         |
         |
      fstreambase  (Not a header file , this class was inside fstream)
    /           \
   /             \
ifstream       ofstream (Separate Header files)
   \             /
    \           /
       fstream	(A Class that is in the Header File Inherited from ifstream & ofstream)


Class Relationships:
1) fstreambase
Base class for file streams
Direct child of iostream

2) istream (Input Stream)
Parent: ios
Used for input operations

3) ostream (Output Stream)
Parent: ios
Used for output operations

4) ifstream (Input File Stream)
Parents: istream (indirect) and fstreambase
Used for reading from files

5) ofstream (Output File Stream)
Parents: ostream(indirect) and fstreambase
Used for writing to files

6) fstream (File Stream)
Parents: iostream (which inherits from both istream and ostream , (indirect)) and fstreambase(indirect) , ifstream (direct) and ofstream (direct)
Used for both reading and writing. fstream uses inheritance to do file I/O and includes their headers to do so also as they are in separate classes



HEADER FILES :
#include <ios>               // ios_base, ios
#include <istream>          // istream , ios , ios_base
#include <ostream>         // ostream , ios , ios_base  
#include <fstream>        // ifstream, ofstream, fstream, fstreambase , whole iostream almost (indirectly)
#include <iostream>      // cin, cout, cerr, clog , istream , ostream  , ios , ios_base 




Current and Standardized Modern C++ Hierarchy :
                     ios_base		
                        |
                 basic_ios<CharT,Traits> 			(A Separate Header File)
                   /            \
basic_istream<CharT,Traits>  basic_ostream<CharT,Traits>	(Separate Header Files)  
                   \            /
             basic_iostream<CharT,Traits> <-- iostream header file that contains iostream class
                        |
            basic_fstream<CharT,Traits>   <-- file stream class (header) , there is no fstreambase , only one class that extends ifstream , ofstream   
                        |
         ---------------------------------------
         |              |                      |
basic_ifstream  basic_ofstream         (other specializations)	(No Header files , only classes declared & defined)

The Header File fstream in old hierarchy was derived from the ifstream and ofstream , no fstreambase class anymore in modern C++ , now fstream is derived from iostream and it just extends ifstream , ofstream header files and defines all 3 classes in its header file fstream to use the functionalities for both file I/O. So fstream itself uses ifstream and ofstream by inheritance in a single file rather than including their headers from different files / classes
