For doing multifiling in templates , just use templates.h or templates.hpp file and put the declarations of the functions there.
Then simply make templates.cpp file and put the implementation of the template.h / hpp functions there with template.h/ hpp included
Then in main.cpp include both files.
If your template uses a user defined data type like a class / struct etc then this template.h / hpp should have included that class/struct's .h file to instantiate properly
It may also work if all your files like class.h , class.cpp are included in main and along with template.cpp and template.h / hpp then it will also work without putting class.h file in the template.h / hpp
