// Creating a Calculator using Inheritance :
// Idea :
/*
Create 2 classes:
    1. SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, /, sqrt , reciprocal ,negative and displays the results using another function.
    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operations of your choice and displays the results using another function.

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes:
    Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using? -----> Multiple Inheritance  (But it can also be done by using Single Inheritance)
    Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using? ----> Public Mode in both base inheritances
    Q3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of the simple and scientific calculator.
    Q4. How is code reusability implemented?
