FACTORY METHOD :
A Factory Method is a design pattern that focuses on decoupling the process of object
creation from the code that uses the object.
It provides an interface (usually a class) for creating an object, but allows subclasses
to decide which class to instantiate. The goal is to let a class defer the instantiation logic to its children.

We implement factory method using :
1) Inheritance ,often more than one type
2) Polymorphism ( Pure Virtual Functions) 
3) Raw Pointers or Smart Pointers

Although pure virtual functions are not strictly necessary , but it depends on the programmer , if you want to instantiate base class , use only virtual functions and if not then use pure virtual functions
Similary use of smart pointers is recommended but you may use raw pointers which is discouraged

 ==== 4 MAIN COMPONENTS OF FACTORY METHOD ====

1) Product (Interface): The base class for the objects being created (e.g., Document).

2) Concrete Product: The actual classes instantiated by the factory (e.g., WordDocument, PdfDocument).

3) Creator (Interface): The base class that declares the Factory Method (e.g., DocumentApp).

4) Concrete Creator: The subclasses that implement the Factory Method to produce a specific concrete product (e.g., WordApp, PdfApp).
