List is an example of Aggregation.
List is a set of collection of Nodes.
It is not Linear Data Structure.
It is usually dynamically allocated (runtime based)
It can be done on either stack or heap ( usually we do on heap)
We can make Linked List using one class (more complex) but then we need to put raw pointers and it becomes very difficult to manage.
We can make Linked List using 2 classes (more easier) , which becomes very easy to manage .
