===========COMPOSITION============
When an object of another class is made inside another class , this is called composition.
We call the covering class as outer class and object inside as inner class object.
Here the lifetime of object is bounded to the outer class object. (Dependent)
We can also make array/vector of objects or use a pointer that can point to many objects.
We say that outer class "OWNS" / "HAS A" the inner class object
E.g if we have outer class A and inner object as class B then we can make :
1) B b;  //Like Variable
2) B b[10]   // Like Array
3) B *b;  // Dynamic Array 
The 3rd one is referred to as aggregation but the objects allocation is done at the time of constructor and deallocation at the time of destructor so it is aggregation but lifetime just like Composition or we can say that here aggregation becomes equivalent to composition

The Outer class object can only use the inner class' public member functions only. 
Also we can make outer class as a friend for inner class so that it can easily access all the private data members of the inner objects
If we use constructor to initialize the inner class object or use the member initialization list then the constructor for the inner class object must be present in its own class that matches the inner class object paramters.
Similarly there are many more things like when using overloaded << operator then we should have this <<operator as friend function and separately for both classes i.e outer and inner class.
So we need to check out for these things 
For static data members of the inner class , they are shared among all class objects even if that object is composed inside another object 
The order of constructor is that , first inner object constructor runs , then the constructor of outer class and order of destructor is opposite
We usually use composition and aggregation more than the nested class as nested class becomes more complicated and not a good design
The Constructor only runs when a new object is created or when the inner object's constructor paramters are passed , not when the object is passed to another object. When an object is passed to inner object as parameter then copy constructor is invoked.

Some people mix up composition , aggregation and inheritance .
These should never be mixed with each other.
See some example and some problems as well.
