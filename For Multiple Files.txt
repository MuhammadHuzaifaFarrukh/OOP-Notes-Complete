Always ensure to make separate files for classes i.e a header file
The Functions Implementations inside classes should be in another .cpp file 
The .cpp file should have a reference of its class using #include "class_name.h"
Use "#pragma once" on all these header files such that they will not be copied if this header is used directly or indirectly in program multiple times
Use the header files or namespaces required to use in these files as needed
Use the header files of base class and include them in the .h portion of the derived class as needed


In main , we only write either this header file and .cpp file and compile and run
OR we only write the header file and then compile by using command with both of their names and then execute it
Also don't include any unnecessary user-defined header files in the .h files , this can cause compilation errors

Difference between #include < > and #include " " :
When we include a header file using "header_file_name.h" , compiler checks for the header file inside our folder , if it doesn't then it finds in the include directory. Also we can give complete path of our header file inside  this " " , its completely your choice. It works for both , standard header files and user-defined as well.



When we use < > for header files , it only checks the include folder , so any user-defined header file won't be added or seen by compiler if we use < > for it unless user himself has put his header file there.
