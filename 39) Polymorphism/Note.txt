We have two types of Polymorphism :
1) Compile-Time Polymorphism : (Static / Early Binding)
 E.g : Function Overloading , Operator Overloading , Template Operator Overloading , Constructor Overloading , Function Templates Overloading , Normal Classes Templates Overloading, Functors.
Decision of execution of function taken at compile time

2) Run-time Polymorphism : (Dynamic / Late Binding)
 E.g : Virtual Functions + Inheritance 
Decision of execution of function taken at run time
